What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 
When you initialize a repository git install all the nessary meta data into a .git folder. The period before the name tells the OS to keep this file hidden. It needs to be done so git can set up all of the needed information into this special folder to keep track of all of the commits and data associated with that. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a space that git uses to stage all of the needed files for the commit. It allows the user to be selective about what they commit. I think this is extremely valuable because you want the commits to be logical. They need to a defined change that is being commited. It saves the user from committing data that is not completed.
