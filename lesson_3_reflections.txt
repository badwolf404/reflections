When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?
If you were planning to work on the project with other people and wanted a way to keep a central file system and not lose track of each others work. If you also wanted to access all of your code and files from any location or computer. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you have another person working on and making changes to the remote repo, it will affect any local changes you have made to your code. It would be better to manually pull down the remote repo so you know what you are getting. Instead of returning to your code and it is completely different or major work was lost.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a Github version of a clone. It is Githubs way of cloning a repo on their own servers and keeping the repo online. A clone is when you copy a repo from github to your local box. it makes an exact copy of what is online and it copies it to your local computer. A branch is a split in the copy of the master code. If you wanted to make changes to your program without changing the master code you create a branch off of the master and make the needed changes only affect the branch and not the master branch. This is all in the same repo. 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to keep track of the difference that are created if you make changes offline. If you make changes offline where you do not have internet access, have the last known state of the remote repo will let you track the differences.
